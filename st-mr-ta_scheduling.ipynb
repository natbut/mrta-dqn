    "\n",
    "We are solving a MRTA problem with single-task robots, multi-robot tasks, and time-extend task allocation. We assume the following constants:\n",
    "- 5 robots (homogeneous efficiency toward tasks, travel at same constant velocity)\n",
    "- 10 tasks (\"rigid\" tasks - require a predetermined number of robots to arrive before work towards completion begins)\n",
    "    - tasks are initialized in random positions\n",
    "\n",
    "Some assumptions/constraints (continue to add):\n",
    "- Once a robot starts on a task (begins to move along edge toward task), it cannot change from this assingment until the task has been completed\n",
    "- With this, once enough robots have arrive at a task for work to begin, work is not interrupted until the task is complete"
